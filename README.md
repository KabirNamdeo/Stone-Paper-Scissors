# Stone-Paper-Scissors game
Stone Paper Scissors
The code starts by asking the user for a choice. The code then checks to see if the input is 1, 2, or 3. If it is not one of those values, the code sets the choice_name variable to 'Rock' if choice == 1, 'paper' if choice == 2, and 'scissor' if choice == 3
